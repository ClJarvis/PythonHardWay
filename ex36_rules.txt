1. every If-statement must have an else
2. if the else statement should never run because it doesn'ymake sense, make a die function in the else that prints an error message. It will help find errors
3. never nest if-statements more than tep deep, try keep them one -deep.
4. Treat if-statement like paragraphs
    where each if-elis-else grouping is like a set of sentences
    put blanks lines before and after.
5. boolean test should be simple
    if the are comples, move their calculations to variables earlier in you function and use a good variable name.


LOOPS
1. use a while-loop only to loop forever, so proabably never, use it rarely, prefer a for-loop.
2. use a for-loopfor all other kinds of looping. expecially if there is a limited number of things to loop over.
